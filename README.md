# VLSI-Implementation-Of-Deep-Neural-Networks-Using-Stochastic-Computing-


Problems faced
1) Unable to provide desirable sequence of the binary input (an image to be passed as i/p to neuron)
2) Implementation of NStanh function using FSM.
3) Generation of stochastic stream using FSM Functions.
4) Implementation of State Transition Diagram for making NStanh function.
